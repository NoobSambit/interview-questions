# Non‑Negotiable Interview Answers (Must‑Know Set)

This folder contains “deep project questions” where interviewers usually try to break the project. Answers are written strictly from code that exists in:
1. `Documents/ARMYVERSE`
2. `Documents/docbuilder`

Every answer is in a speaking style (4–8 minutes explainable) and follows the structure:
1. Short intro
2. Step-by-step explanation
3. Design reasoning (why I did it)
4. Possible improvement (1–2 lines)
5. Hard Terms Explained Simply
