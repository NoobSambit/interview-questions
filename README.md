## Suggested Practice Order

1. Phase 01 + Phase 08 (intro + HR polish)
2. Phase 02 + Phase 04 (project basics)
3. Phase 07 (core fundamentals for fresher rounds)
4. Phase 03 + Phase 05 (intermediate/deep technical)
5. Phase 06 (system design + tradeoffs)

## Notes

- Some questions are intentionally cross-check style to prepare you for tough interviewers.
- Some are scenario/debugging questions to simulate real technical rounds.
- Answers are written in simple interview speaking style and include codebase references.
- Long-form files are for "explain in depth" rounds where interviewer asks 3-8 minute answers.
- Long-form answer files are detailed speaking templates for project-defense rounds.
