# Phase 01 - Resume and Screening Questions

## A) Opening and Profile Pitch

1. Tell me about yourself in 60-90 seconds.
2. Walk me through your resume from education to projects.
3. Why did you choose CSE with Bioinformatics specialization?
4. How did you move from coursework to full-stack + AI projects?
5. What type of role are you targeting: frontend, backend, full-stack, or AI engineering?
6. What are your top 3 strengths as a fresher?
7. What is one technical weakness you are currently improving?
8. Which project are you most confident explaining end-to-end, and why?
9. If I give you one month, what skill would you sharpen first for this role?
10. Why should we hire you over other freshers with similar tech stacks?

## B) Resume Metrics and Claim Validation

11. Your resume says 1000+ signed-in users for ArmyVerse. How did you measure this?
12. Your resume says 21 MongoDB models, but your repo has more model files. Explain the difference.
13. You mentioned 60+ serverless endpoints. How did you count them, and what counts as an endpoint?
14. You mentioned 1000+ quiz questions. What was your source and quality check process?
15. You said 150+ collectible photocards. How was this ingested and deduplicated?
16. You mentioned AES-256-GCM encryption. What exactly is encrypted and why?
17. You said PKCE secretless OAuth. Why was PKCE needed in your BYO Spotify flow?
18. You claim token-bucket rate limiting at 5 req/sec. Where is this applied and why 5?
19. You claim AI prompt strategy of 400+ lines. How did you iterate and evaluate prompt quality?
20. You said sub-5 second inference in DocBuilder. Under what conditions and model settings?
21. You claim hallucination reduction via RAG. How did you validate this qualitatively or quantitatively?
22. You mention CI/CD with Railway + Vercel. Describe your deployment pipeline from commit to production.
23. You mention automated tests (Pytest/Jest). What core flows are currently covered?
24. Which resume bullet is strongest evidence of production engineering maturity?
25. Which resume bullet is most likely to be challenged by a strict interviewer?

## C) Education and Fresher Positioning

26. As a final-year student, how do you balance fundamentals vs framework knowledge?
27. Which coursework helped you most in these two projects, and how?
28. How has DBMS coursework influenced your schema and indexing decisions?
29. How has OS knowledge helped with concurrency and process understanding?
30. How has CN knowledge helped with auth, HTTP, and API design decisions?
31. How do you approach learning when documentation is incomplete?
32. Tell me about one failure in these projects and what you changed after it.
33. If you had more time before graduation, what would you rebuild first?
34. What is your approach to writing maintainable code in team settings?
35. How do you estimate task effort when requirements are ambiguous?

## D) Stack and Role Alignment

36. Why Next.js for ArmyVerse but FastAPI + Next.js split for DocBuilder?
37. Why MongoDB in one project and Firestore-centric patterns in the other?
38. Why Groq + Llama 3.3 70B instead of OpenAI or Gemini for these use cases?
39. If hired as backend-focused fresher, what immediate value can you deliver in 30 days?
40. If hired as full-stack fresher, what would be your development workflow from ticket to PR?
