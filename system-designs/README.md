# Comprehensive System Designs

This folder contains full, interview-grade system design documents for your two core projects.

## Files

- `armyverse-comprehensive-system-design.md`
- `docbuilder-comprehensive-system-design.md`

## How To Use

1. Read each document once end-to-end.
2. Practice explaining each section in your own words.
3. Focus extra on:
   - architecture tradeoffs
   - data consistency and idempotency
   - security design
   - scaling and reliability roadmap
4. Use sequence diagrams to practice long-form “walk me through the flow” answers.

## Recommended Practice Order

1. ArmyVerse: Sections 1-8 (core architecture + data + flows)
2. DocBuilder: Sections 1-8 (AI pipeline + data + flows)
3. Both: Sections 9 onward (security, scaling, ops, roadmap)
