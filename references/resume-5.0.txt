Projects
  ArmyVerse | Next.js 14, TypeScript, MongoDB, Groq (Llama 3.3 70B), Firebase, Spotify API                  GitHub | Live
     – Architected a production-ready Full Stack platform with 1000+ signed-in users using Next.js 14 App Router and
       TypeScript, managing 21 MongoDB models and 60+ serverless API endpoints supporting blogging, gaming, and
       analytics modules with 1000+ quiz questions and 150+ collectible photocards.
     – Engineered a BYO Spotify app system bypassing the 25-user dev limit through encrypted Client ID/Secret
       (AES-256-GCM), PKCE secretless OAuth, and dual-mode playlist export supporting unlimited concurrent users.
     – Built an AI-powered music recommendation engine integrating Groq SDK (Llama 3.3 70B) with 400+ line prompt
       strategy processing 15+ acoustic parameters; developed a quest system with Last.fm integration featuring
       daily/weekly streaming challenges, fuzzy track matching, token bucket rate limiting (5 req/sec), and 34 collectible
       badges.
     – Developed a complex gamification system (Boraverse) featuring pity-based RNG economy (guaranteed epic every
       15 pulls, legendary every 50 pulls), crafting logic with dust economy, and ISO-week leaderboards handling state
       management for 150+ collectible assets with server-side anti-cheat validation.
     – Implemented dual-authentication combining Firebase Admin SDK (OAuth) and custom JWT, securing data with
       AES-256-GCM encryption and Zod validation; built real-time data pipeline with Cheerio scrapers, automated Cron
       jobs, and compound indexes for sub-second retrieval; created a Tiptap-based CMS with 20+ extensions supporting
       nested comments and soft-deletion.

  AI Document & Presentation Builder | Python, FastAPI, LangChain, Next.js, Groq, RAG, Firebase GitHub | Live
     – Engineered an enterprise-grade GenAI platform using FastAPI and Next.js automating structured
       document/PowerPoint creation with LangChain orchestration, Pydantic validation, and asynchronous processing
       optimizing LLM inference to under 5 seconds.
     – Architected a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system integrating Google Custom Search and FAISS vector
       storage to ground Llama 3.3 70B outputs in real-time web data with HuggingFace embeddings for semantic
       similarity search, significantly reducing hallucinations.
     – Developed a context-aware refinement engine analyzing adjacent section summaries for global document coherence
       with sliding window context management and automatic word count adjustments (±30%) based on natural
       language instructions.
     – Built a dual-pipeline export service using python-docx and python-pptx rendering HTML content into 4
       professional themes with dynamic layout adjustment; established production CI/CD pipeline deploying stateless
       backend to Railway and frontend to Vercel with automated testing suites (Pytest/Jest).
